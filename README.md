# bourbon-compass

This project is simply a repackaging of thoughtbot's [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io/) as a Compass extension. I try to keep it in sync and up to date with Bourbon.

If you like this, check out my Compass port of thoughtbot's [Neat](http://neat.bourbon.io/), [neat-compass](https://github.com/jedfoster/neat-compass)

## Installation

`gem install bourbon-compass`

In your Compass config file: `require 'bourbon-compass'`.

In your Sass file: `@import 'bourbon/bourbon'`
